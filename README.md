# 🤖 Machine Learning Model Implementation
Created a predictive ("Spam Email Detection") model using "Scikit-learn" and natural language processing techniques (Vectorization Technique) to classify or predict outcomme from a dataset.
# 🔍 Source
I have built a spam vs. ham classifier using Python, Scikit-learn, and a structured 'emails.csv' dataset containing labeled email messages.
# ❓How to run the code ?
## 🔧 To run the code:-
### • Copy the code in your Jupyter Notebook.
### • Install the necessary libraries mentioned in the code.
### • Also download the .csv file that has been used, to analyse and get the output.
### • Make sure to keep them in the same folder/directory.
### • Run the code.
# 📈 Output
After giving the user input, the model analyzes the input and then tells you that the email is of which type, i.e it is either a Spam or it is a Ham (Non-Spam).
